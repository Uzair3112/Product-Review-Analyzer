# Product-Review-Analyzer
The user selects key attributes of a product such as its brand, category, and whether itâ€™s recommended to receive a predicted review rating generated by a machine learning model.
This predicted rating helps the user evaluate product quality before making a purchase decision. By simulating how real users might rate the product, the app serves as a smart assistant for making informed buying choices.
